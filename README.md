# 🍲 System Design is Like Cooking a Dish

Before diving into servers, caches, and databases, think of system design like preparing your favorite recipe.

When you're about to cook:
- You decide what dish to make → 📌 Define the problem and requirements
- You gather ingredients and spices → 🧩 Identify system components (databases, services, APIs)
- You choose your tools → 🔧 Select technologies (frameworks, load balancers, queues)
- You adjust spices to your taste → ⚙️ Tune for performance, scalability, or cost
- You follow a sequence → 🔄 Define data flow, interactions, and architecture layers
- You taste and tweak → 📈 Monitor, test, and iterate for reliability and improvement

| Cooking | System Design |
|--------|----------------|
| Dish (e.g., biryani, pasta) | System purpose (e.g., Instagram, banking app) |
| Ingredients | Components (DB, cache, frontend, backend) |
| Tools (pots, ladle) | Tech stack (Java, Redis, Kafka, React) |
| Spice adjustment | Scaling & tuning |
| Recipe steps | System architecture & data flow |
| Taste & fix | Logging, monitoring, iteration |

> Just like a dish needs the right balance of ingredients, timing, and technique to taste great, a system needs the right architecture, components, and flow to work at scale.
