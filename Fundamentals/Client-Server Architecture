**#Client-Server Architecture**
Almost every web application we use today is built on a client-server architecture.
When a client sends a request from a web browser or mobile app, the server receives the request, processes it, and sends a response back.

For example, if you want to buy a pair of shoes, you might open the Adidas website and search for a specific model. The request is sent to the server, which then searches the database for that model. 
If found, the server responds with the relevant product details.
This is the basic architecture weâ€™re referring to.
